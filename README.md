# PlayerEfficiencyRating
This program will calculate a basketball player's player efficiency rating (PER). 

Based on a player's PER, the program gives a description of that player's general role on the team but it will not be 100% right all the time. The
prediction of that player's role on the team is based on Wikipedia's guidelines around PER 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_efficiency_rating).
